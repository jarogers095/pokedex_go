# PokedexGo

PokedexGo is an application that scrapes data from the website "gamepress.gg.pokemongo" and presents it to the user via a convenient commandline interface. This data is useful for players of the mobile OS game "Pokemon Go," a game that focuses on collecting creatures and using them to battle other players. 

A user can view a list of all available Pokemon, search by name or the number the game catalogues the Pokemon by. Once a user has selected a specific Pokemon, they can view details such as Pokemon type, attack and defense stats, attack pools, attack ratings, combat ranking, type strengths and weaknesses, and many more.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pokedex_go'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pokedex_go
